This is a one-dimensional using a true function, two-dimensional using a true function, and two-dimensional using an objective function implementation of bayesian optimization.

- Start with the notebook **Overview_of_Intelligent_Bayesian_Optimization**, which explains
what bayesian optimization is.
- Then, within the notebooks folder you can view
**Gaussian_Process_Hyperparameter_Selection_1D_2D** which compares this implementation to
Grid Search and Random Grid Search over one and two dimensions.
- Next, the notebook
**Compare_IBO_to_Implementation** shows how my implementation performs compared to
the Bayesian_Optimization package
-Finally under python_scripts, you can view the *Intelligent Bayesian Optimization* class which contains a .fit(), .predict(), and .maximize() methods.

<>Below, you can view some of the results<>
