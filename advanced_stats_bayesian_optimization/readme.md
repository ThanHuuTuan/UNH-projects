This is a one-dimensional implementation of bayesian optimization.
Start with the notebook *Overview_of_Intelligent_Bayesian_Optimization*, which explains
what bayesian optimization is. Then, within the notebooks folder you can view
*Gaussian_Process_Hyperparameter_Selection_1D_2D* which compares this implementation to
Grid Search and Random Grid Search over one and two dimensions. Finally, the notebook
*Compare_IBO_to_Implementation* shows how my implementation performs compared to
the Bayesian_Optimization package
The notebook Gaussian_Process_Hyperparameter_Selection_Jonathan_Hilgart.ipynb outlines the implmentation.
