# glavanize-projects
Here you will find various projects I worked on while studying at Galvanize.

Index

**Semester One**

- 1) *Statistics_Probability_EDA_Feature_Engineering*: contains a statistical analysis of Lending Club loans from 2008-~2015 (Pandas, Seaborn, Probability Distributions, Generalized Linear Models, Statsmodels). 

- 2) *Linear_Algebra*: contains a continued analysis of Lending Club loans using SVD and PCA to decompose these matrices and project if people would end up either defaulting or paying off their loan. (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib).

**Semester Two**

- 3) *Natural_Language_Processing*: contains a mad libs style choose your own adventure story (Information Retreival with TF-IDF / Jaccard Similarity, word2vec, Named Entity Recognition, Part of Speech tagging, Spacey, NLTK).

- 4) *Machine_Learning_I*: contains various machine learning models built off of Ultimatum Game data ( a variant of Prisoner's Dilemma) with the goal of maximizing your payoff (Tree Boosting, Random Forests, Regularized Regression, KNN Clustering, Stacking/Ensemble methods, Sklearn).

**Semester Three**

- 4) *Data_Engineering*: has an overview of a bart ridership prediction system incorporating real time bart, and weather, information alongside historic bart, and weather, information. (Spark, MLlib, S3, EC2, EMR, MongoDB, boto, Airflow)

- 5) *Data_Leadership*: outlines the final business case presentation we completed. This case looked at a hospital chain to understand, and make recommendations, for how to reduce patient readmissions. (Data Science ROI, Cost Benefit Analysis, Pandas, Sklearn)
