Here you will find my final project, and final paper, from the Linear Algebra course.

The final project compared the differences between SVD and PCA for numeric Lending Club data. 
In addition, the first eigenvector from PCA was used to classify people as 1=will pay back loan or 2=will not pay back loan.
The final paper, and iPython notebook, contain more information.

PCA used on Lending Club data. The magnitude of each eigenvalue is displayed in a elbow plot. In addition, the most important
features from each eigenvector are plotted (Take the index of the largest element of each eigenvector, and scale this by
the corresponding eigenvalue).

Projection data along first eigenvalue. This use Euclidean distance to determine the classification of each person.
