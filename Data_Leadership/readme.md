# Tahoe Healthcare is a fictional hospital chain that is facing $750,000 in penalities under the Affordable Care Act from patient readmissions.

- Our task in this case was to investigate the data of ~4,300 patients to determine the best way to for Tahoe Heathlcare to save money over doing nothing.
- The notebook contains an overview of the model run (both managerial clustering and various clustering algorithms).
- My findings suggest that Tahoe Healthcare can save **$430,000** annually with minimal implementation cost.
