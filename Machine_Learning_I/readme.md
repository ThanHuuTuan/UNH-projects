This project was an analysis of the Ultimatum Game (a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma).



- **ML_Final_Ultimatum_Game.ipynb** : Contains the code where I did model fitting, an ensemble method of multiple models,
and an analysis of the ultimatum game data.

- **Ultimatum-Game-ML1-6003-Jonathan-Hilgart (1).pdf**: Contains a presentationon the results of the analysis with 
some decent visuals.

- **MachineLearningI-AlgorithmAppendix-JonathanHIlgart.pdf** : Outlines the different algorithms used in the model building process.
