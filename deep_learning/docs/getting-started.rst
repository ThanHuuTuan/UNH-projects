The data can be accessed from http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
In order to create the pre-processed data file that was used, you will need to use the

Once you have the data preprocessed, you can run the RL network to test out the performance.
However, in order to see real results, you should upload the script to a GPU instance
on AWS to speed up training.
